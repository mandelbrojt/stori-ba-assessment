# Business Analyst Interview Assessment

This is the first step of Storis's interview process for the Business Analyst role. 

This assessment will evaluate basic competencies on the following areas:
- Problem solving skills;
- Basic data manipulations;
- Getting insights and recommendations from data;
- Written communication in English.

# Results

## Part 1

For the first part of this assessment I created the following files:
- `part1-state-of-business-analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook to answer all of the questions.
- `income_model.py`: A Python module that performs all of the calculations.
- `income_results.csv`: The results of the forecasts for Contigo A and B.
- `model-explanation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains step by step all of the calculations for the income model module.

## Part 2

For the second part of this assessment I created the following files:
- `part2-collection-strategy-analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook to answer all of the questions.
- `stori_database.sql`: A SQL script that can be imported into a local instance of MySQL to replicate the database.
- `collection_campaing.sql`: A SQL script that computes the results.
- `collections_results.csv`: The results of the collection strategy.


I recommend using the following files for a quick view of the results:
- `part1-state-of-business-analysis.html`
- `part2-collection-strategy-analysis.html`
